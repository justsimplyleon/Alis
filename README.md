### Expect a well written README later, but for now...

Here's what you can do with this:
💙 Use it freely: You can use my code for your projects
🖌️ Change it: Feel free to modify the code as you like
🚀 Share and sell: You can share your creations and even sell things you make with it
👤 Give credit: Just make sure to mention my name in your project(along with any other necessary contributers)
✨ Enjoy! I hope it's helpful, but it comes as is
